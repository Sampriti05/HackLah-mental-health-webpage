<h1>Issue</h1>
 <p>The problem that I have identified to focus on in this project is of Mental Health.Based on some of the personal readings and research I have done I noticed the spike in the demographic of people facing mental health issues after COVID-19 due to being isolated for long periods of time with limited human interactions. This situation brought out existing mental illnesses that people have been dismissing for years.In some cases the isolation period has intensified the effects that come alongside with these illnesses. While there has also been an increase in educational materials and apps that help with mental illnesses, I wanted to create a website which Involves both educational information and a method of coping with such illnesses, Journaling.</p>
  
 <h1>Webpage Key features</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Homepage</li>
    <p>This page involves information about the different types of illnesses and the data etc. This is to allow those who have limited knowledge on what kind of illness they may be suffering from.This is purely for self knowledge and not for self - diagnosis ->included warning at the top </p>
    <li>Journalling</li>
      <p>Research has shown that journalling proves to be a good form of mental use and release and is a good form of self care practice. This page provides a space where users can write out any experience which they may have been holding heavy in their heart and release it.Due to time constraints I was not able to include a entry history section where users can look through their past entries and see their progress.</p>
    <li>Tips</li>
    <p>This page provides 10 tips for users to relieve any mental stresses they face in their life.There is also a collection of helplines provided at the bottom in case anyone ever faces the situation of using them.</p>
